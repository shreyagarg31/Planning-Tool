# Planning-Tool
 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
### HOME PAGE
A grid of sticky notes(aka highlights) are visible. A functionality is provided at the top to add new note with inputs of Title , description and author. The notes can be edited and deleted as well. Styling effects have been added to provide good user-experience. Notes can be dragged across the window anywhere. Edit functionality allows us to assign bucket name to any note. A button "Group Highlights" is present in top right corner of the page to show all the groups/buckets user has created for the notes.

### GROUPS PAGE
This page shows all the existing categories and provide a functionality on the top to add new group by providing the title and notes. Notes are selected by means of a dropdown list to choose ones that are to be grouped. Categories have notes represented by means of titles which can be dragged and dropped into any category. Styling has been taken care of to provide good user experience while drag-drop.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
